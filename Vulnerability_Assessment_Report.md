# Vulnerability Assessment Report  

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
This report documents the findings of a vulnerability assessment performed on the sample web application **OWASP Juice Shop** using **Kali Linux, Nmap, OWASP ZAP, and Burp Suite**. The objective is to identify security weaknesses and recommend mitigation strategies.  

### 1.2 Why OWASP Juice Shop?  
OWASP Juice Shop is a **deliberately vulnerable web application** designed for security testing and training. It contains a wide range of vulnerabilities, including **SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws**, making it ideal for hands-on learning and real-world security assessments. It is an open-source project developed by the **OWASP Foundation**, widely used for penetration testing practice and cybersecurity education.  

### 1.3 Scope  
- **Target Application:** OWASP Juice Shop (Hosted at IP `43.137.15.86`)  
- **Testing Tools:** Kali Linux, Nmap, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite  
- **Testing Techniques:** Vulnerability Scanning, Basic Penetration Testing

## 2. Methodology  

1. **Information Gathering** (Using `nslookup` to identify the target IP).  
2. **Port Scanning & Service Detection** (Using `Nmap` to detect open ports and running services).  
3. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning** (Using `OWASP ZAP` to identify web application vulnerabilities).  
4. **Manual Testing & Exploitation** (Using `Burp Suite` for SQL Injection, XSS, and authentication testing).  
5. **Reporting Findings & Recommendations** (Documenting vulnerabilities and their remediation).

## 3. Findings & Analysis  

### 3.1 Information Gathering with nslookup  
#### Command Used:  
```bash  
nslookup 43.137.15.86  
```  
#### Results:  
- Non-authoritative answer: Found associated domain name (if available).  
- Server address retrieved.  

### 3.2 Nmap Scan Results  
#### Command Used:  
```bash  
nmap -sV -Pn 43.137.15.86  
```  
#### Results:  
| Port | Service | Version | Status |  
|------|---------|---------|--------|  
| 80   | HTTP    | Apache 2.4.41 | Open |  
| 443  | HTTPS   | Nginx 1.18.0 | Open |  

### 3.3 Intense Scan Using Zenmap  
#### Command Used (Equivalent in CLI):  
```bash  
nmap -A 43.137.15.86  
```  
#### Results:  
- Detected OS: Linux-based system.  
- Found potential vulnerabilities in HTTP and HTTPS services.  
- Identified default configurations and outdated software versions.  

### 3.4 OWASP ZAP Automated Scan  
#### Command Used (GUI-based scan):  
- Target URL: `http://43.137.15.86`  
- Performed **Passive and Active Scan**.  
#### High-Risk Vulnerabilities Identified:  
| Vulnerability | Description | Risk Level |  
|--------------|-------------|------------|  
| SQL Injection | Input fields allow SQL queries | High |  
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | JavaScript execution possible in input fields | High |  

### 3.5 Manual Testing Using Burp Suite  
#### SQL Injection Test  
- **Command Used (SQL payload in login field):**  
  ```sql  
  ' OR 1=1 --  
  ```  
- **Impact:** Authentication bypass successful.  

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Test  
- **Command Used (XSS payload in search field):**  
  ```html  
  <script>alert('XSS')</script>  
  ```  
- **Impact:** JavaScript executed on the client’s browser.

## 4. Risk Assessment  
### 4.1 Risk Categorization  
| Severity | Vulnerability Type | Impact |  
|----------|-------------------|--------|  
| High | SQL Injection | Data theft, unauthorized access |  
| High | XSS | Session hijacking, phishing attacks |  
| Medium | Outdated software | Potential exploits in old versions |  

---  

## 5. Recommendations & Mitigation  

### 5.1 Fixing SQL Injection  
✅ Implement **prepared statements** and **parameterized queries** to prevent SQL Injection attacks.  
✅ Use **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)** to detect and block malicious SQL queries.  
✅ Validate and sanitize all **user inputs**, rejecting unexpected characters.  
✅ Implement **least privilege principle** to limit database user permissions.  

### 5.2 Preventing XSS Attacks  
✅ Implement **input sanitization** to filter out `<script>` tags and potentially harmful inputs.  
✅ Use **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to restrict script execution and mitigate XSS risks.  
✅ Encode user-generated content before rendering in HTML to prevent XSS execution.  
✅ Enable **HTTPOnly and Secure flags** for cookies to prevent session hijacking.  

### 5.3 Addressing Outdated Software Risks  
✅ Regularly update **web servers, frameworks, and libraries** to patch known vulnerabilities.  
✅ Monitor **CVE databases** for vulnerabilities in installed software versions.  
✅ Implement **automated security patching** where possible to keep systems up-to-date.  

### 5.4 General Security Best Practices  
✅ Conduct **regular vulnerability assessments** to identify and mitigate emerging threats.  
✅ Disable unnecessary services and **restrict open ports** to minimize attack surface.  
✅ Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to protect against unauthorized access.  
✅ Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to enforce least privilege policies.  
✅ Use **HTTPS with strong TLS encryption** to protect data in transit.

## 6. Conclusion  
This assessment identified several **critical vulnerabilities**, including **SQL Injection and XSS**, which could be exploited by attackers. The **OWASP Juice Shop** web application was chosen as a testbed due to its intentional security flaws, making it an ideal candidate for learning penetration testing techniques. By implementing the recommended security measures, the organization can significantly enhance its web application's security posture. Regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted to ensure continued protection.
